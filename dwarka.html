       <p class="text-capitalize"> Once in a life everyone has a dream and that dream is to travel with friends.
        Very few people can experience it in real.
        And I am fortunate enough to get this experience in a life.</p>


       

      <p class="text-capitalize">
        This time I was traveling with my bunch of friends and that's why this was my one of the best trips ever.
        Our journey started from Ahmedabad and we took a bus ride to reach Dwarka.</p>

    <p class="text-capitalize">
      It was the time when winter was about to go .there was slight cold atmosphere along with the dew and the moon was shining through the dew.
      This sight  from window seat was enough to give me the goosebumps and I couldn't resist myself from bringing out from window and from taking the cold breeze of air.
    </p>
    <p class="text-capitalize">
      Early morning we reached at Dwarka and freshen up and  after taking breakfast, we left for shivrajpur to experience the adventure and the adventure was scuba diving.
      First of all scuba instructor gave us the instructions about how to communicate under the water and then provided us with the scuba costume and we were ready to have thrill.
      After having all the stuffs on my back including oxygen cylinder I jumped into the water and slowly experiencing all things around me.

        </div>
    </div>

          <p class="text-capitalize">
            Gradually I sank down under the water and found myself surrounded by sea-plants , different types of fishesh and the various types of stones.
            I was suddenly aware of how my movements connect with each intake of breath and realised that being immersed in water is such a sensory experience.</p>


          <p class="text-capitalize">
            After coming back from scuba , I was feeling absolutely quite, there were no thoughts , just me and my blank mind..</p> 

          
          <p class="text-capitalize">One thing I must say that ,more than anything else,my first scuba dive gave me a much deeper appreciation of our oceans and renewed sense of environmental stewardship to protect them.
            Life underwater, as I explored during my scuba diving experience, was much more than I imagined..</p>

          <p class="text-capitalize">We took lunch at there and then left for beyt Dwarka Iceland .
            The most beautiful thing at ocean is the sunset.one should experience it once in a life.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-capitalize">There were endless water and the sun was setting down behind the water and the rays of sun reflecting on the surface of water ,that view was magnificence.</p>

        <p class="text-capitalize">At night, camp fire has set and seating around camp fire and gossiping is the best part of camp as all the people get the chance to communicate with each other and have fun.
          Then we took a walk at  the edge of the ocean and sat there with the group of people.</p>

          

       

        <div id="carouselExampleSlidesOnly" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel">

                <h6 class="text-center text-capitalize">Full moon at beyt dwarka iceland</h6>
              </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-capitalize">All were started talking about their life and eventually all were going silent and just enjoying the full moon.
          The glow of the moonlight on the water of ocean is truly mesmerising.
         I felt a sense of peace and calm that urged me to continue seating there till the late night.
         At late night we went for sleep although our heart didn't allow us to go because of that beautiful and unforgettable moment.</p>

        <p class="text-capitalize">Next day, we went for dolphin exploration, took a boat ride for near about 4-5 hours.
          We explored the dolphins and took the lunch at the middle of ocean.
          Taking the lunch at the middle of ocean with the strangers and sharing meal with them was an indescribable moment of my life.</p>


        

            <p class="text-capitalize">In the evening we explored dwarka.
              We visited dwarkadhis temple , Gomti ghat and sudama settu.
              And how one can avoid the local food while visiting the unknown or new places.so, we enjoyed the different types of dishes and came to the bus and finally left to come back home.

            <p class="text-capitalize">The most difficult part of journey is coming back,when you are returning to your home , you have new friends, new bonds and lots of memories which will make you emotionally weak.
              This type of temporary journey gives  you the parmenant people in your life.
              We plan the journey but the fact is that journey plans for us.
              This was our unplanned trip and the unplanned things are more exciting. </p>

              <p class="text-capitalize">So, next time if you get problems in your life ,just pack your bag and get lost in the clouds , at the ocean or in the mountains.
                You may get the solution of your problems or you may not but one thing is sure you will learn something new and that will change your perspective towards the life.
                So , this was all about my best ever journey of Dwarka.</p>
